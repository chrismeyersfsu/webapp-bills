== Overview ==

As a student of FSU, easily view your semester schedule and the corresponding books.

* Cross-platform
* Automatically pull down your class schedule from FSU blackboard
* List used, new, and rent book prices

== Status ==

Currently not working for several reasons.
* FSU now uses my.fsu.edu for the course schedule
* this app requires a web component. Sort of a proxy that issues the login and get schedule requests.

== Dependencies and Setup ==

* python, Flask
<pre>sudo pip install -r requirements.txt</pre>

== Run ==

<pre>python ./form.py</pre>
